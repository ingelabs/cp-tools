* GNU Bytecode no longer mirrored in CVS repository, version 1.7.91 
  (unreleased) of Kawa is required, which will create the necessary 
  separate bytecode.jar file.
* The tool native2ascii has been imported from Kaffe with the agreement 
  of the authors.
* The tools rmic and rmiregistry have been imported from GNU Classpath 
  and will be subsequently removed from the library CVS directories.
* New build system based on automake and autoconf no longer requires Ant.  
  To avoid creating native executables with gcj, specify --disable-gcj as 
  an option to configure since they are created by default.  The build 
  with gcj requires GNU JAXP or equivalent as part of the default gcj 
  environment.
